# Review Assessment - Express

We're doing this primarily to help us understand how well you've absorbed.  Don't stress out that we will be using this test to judge you in any way except to understand how we can better help you.

Also, we ask that you don't help each other or cheat.  Feel free to use any online resource but don't copy/paste answers to each other or if you find something similar online.

## Resources

This test is "open book"â€”feel free to use any resources online or otherwise. On the other hand, do **not** copy and paste. Your code should be your own.

## Starting

1. Seed the database with `node seed`
2. Read through the project as it currently stands
3. Start working through the tests in `test.js` (run `npm test` to see how you're doing). You may have to mark them as active (from pending) by changing `xit` to `it`
